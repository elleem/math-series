## Math-series

Author: Lauren

Version: 1.0

#### Overview
Welcome to test driven development. 
Write at least 15 test cases and take the time to do the testing right. 

1) Using recursion create a fibonacci sequence function, that accepts a num value.
2) Using recursion create a lucas sequence function, that accepts a num value.
3) Write a function that accepts one required param and two optional params. 
 Calling this function with no optional params will produce nums from the fibonacci sequence. 
 Calling this function with 2 and 1 will produce nums from the lucas sequence.
